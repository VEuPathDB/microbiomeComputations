microbiomeComputations is an R package which provides helper functions for performing common analyses

# df is a data frame of abundance values with samples as rows. One column should hold the sample id, all other columns are assumed to be taxa
# the 'recordIdColumn' is the name of the column that contains the sample ids.
# 'method' can be 'simpson', 'shannon', or 'evenness'.
dt <- alphaDiv(df, recordIdColumn="entity.SampleID", method='simpson')
```
