)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.table with rows corresponding to records, one column indicating the record id, and all other columns corresponding to taxa abundance.}

\item{cutoff}{integer indicating the maximium number of taxa to be kept after ranking.}

\item{verbose}{boolean indicating if timed logging is desired}
}
